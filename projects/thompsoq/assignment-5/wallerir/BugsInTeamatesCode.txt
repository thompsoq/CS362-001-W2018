Bug Report.
#1
Bug Name: LPYRDYS Number: #0000000
Symptom: incorrect number of days in February.
Cause: Incorrect addition amount when compensating for a leap year.
How to reproduce: If the Year is divisible by 4 or 400, but not 100, the program will attempt to 
compensate for lost time due to time differences between years in the Gregorian Calender.
It does so by making it a leap year, which adds a single day to February, the shortest month.
However, the program seems to add five days instead of one.

The ability to make this an appointment at this time does not harm the program. It only
serves to harm the user at their discretion, because they would need to be the ones to
placed the appointment.
Priority of bug: 1 - Lowest priority/10 - Highest priority: This bug is a priority 6.
This bug is a fairly obvious one that can be exploited. This would discourage customers
from purchasing the application if rolled out if word got out that the application had
such obvious bugs.
